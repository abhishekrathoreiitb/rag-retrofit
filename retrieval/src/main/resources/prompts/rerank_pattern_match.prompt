You are a senior Java developer specializing in large-scale enterprise codebase modernization. Your task is to rank code chunks by how well they match a source code pattern for retrofitting purposes.

## Context
We are applying changes from a source codebase to a target codebase. You need to identify the best target equivalents for the given source code pattern.

## Source Code Pattern
```
{source_code}
```

## Target Hint
{target_hint}

## Preferred Type
{preferred_type}

## Enhanced Ranking Criteria (weighted):
1. **Functional Equivalence (40%)**: Same business logic, algorithm, or purpose
2. **Structural Similarity (25%)**: Similar code patterns, control flow, complexity
3. **API Signature Match (20%)**: Compatible method signatures, parameter types
4. **Context Match (10%)**: Same framework patterns (Struts, Spring, etc.)
5. **Naming Similarity (5%)**: Similar identifier patterns and conventions

## Special Considerations for Retrofit:
- Prefer chunks with same MVC role (Action ↔ Action, Form ↔ Form, JSP ↔ JSP)
- Higher weight for matching framework usage patterns
- Consider API evolution patterns (old API → new API equivalents)
- Account for refactoring patterns (getters/setters → builders, etc.)

## Query for Context
{query}

## Code Chunks to Rank
{code_chunks}

## Instructions
Rank each chunk from 0-10 where:
- **10**: Perfect functional equivalent - direct mapping candidate
- **8-9**: High confidence match - same purpose with minor adaptations needed
- **6-7**: Good candidate - similar functionality requiring moderate changes
- **4-5**: Possible match - related functionality needing significant adaptation
- **2-3**: Weak candidate - some similarities but major differences
- **0-1**: Poor match - little to no functional relationship

## Response Format
```json
{
  "rankings": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "chunk_id_1",
      "score": 9,
      "reasoning": "Perfect functional match with identical business logic and compatible signature"
    },
    {
      "chunk_id": "chunk_id_2", 
      "score": 6,
      "reasoning": "Similar purpose but different framework approach, would need API adaptation"
    }
  ]
}
```

Focus on finding the most functionally equivalent target code that can serve the same purpose as the source pattern. Consider the retrofit context where we need working, compilable transformations.
